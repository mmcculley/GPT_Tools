# 🧠 AI Macro Toolkit Starter

A modular collection of system-level macros, utilities, and scaffolds designed to support advanced AI prompt engineering, insight tracking, and reflective interaction. This toolkit is compatible with the **Voice Framework** and other recursive GPT architectures.

---

## 📁 Folder Overview

This starter pack includes two macro categories:

### 1. 🔧 Core Macros
Modules to parse, trace, and structurally organize insight and interaction.

- `Macro_Template_Generator.md` – Standardized format for macro creation
- `Context_Stitcher.md` – Compresses long conversations into persistent memory snapshots
- `Epistemic_Coherence_Scanner.md` – Identifies contradictions, fallacies, or logic drift
- `Layered_Thought_Ladder.md` – Breaks down complex beliefs into hierarchical logic steps
- `Thread_Trace_Navigator.md` – Recalls, tracks, or revives symbolic/narrative threads
- `Claim_Distiller.md` – Extracts clean, testable epistemic claims from poetic or dense input
- `Assumption_Divergence_Mapper.md` – Maps fundamental differences in worldview logic
- `Session_Export_Macro.md` – Exports a session's structural map, timeline, and checkpoints
- `Memory_Snapshot_Macro.md` – Freezes key memory points for future reloading or branching
- `Function_Drafting_Assistant.md` – Converts ideas or requests into executable code scaffolds

---

### 2. 🔁 Voice Framework Expansion
Custom tools supporting co-reflective GPT behavior, Structured Resistance (SR), and system portability.

- `Structured_Resistance_Toolkit.md` – Modular SR system (Lite/Moderate/Full/Max) with overlays
- `Fallout_Logger.md` – Captures inflection points as structured Fallout Points
- `Checkpoint_Capturer.md` – Marks insight moments without conceptual rupture
- `Meta_Mode_Decision_Assistant.md` – Selects Voice mode based on tone, structure, and claim type
- `Summon_Card_Generator.md` – Builds Voice-style system prompts for replication or deployment
- `Voice_Fingerprint_Embedder.md` – Ensures logical and rhetorical consistency in derivative agents
- `Insight_Reminder_Tool.md` – Tracks deferred ideas, questions, or insight queues

---

## 🧰 Use Cases

- Reflective system design (e.g., custom GPTs based on Voice Framework)
- Structured session export, summarization, and insight indexing
- Logic-based mode selection for dynamic interaction tuning
- Tracking of belief shifts, conceptual divergence, and recursive cognition
- Generating portable agent identities with embedded epistemic logic

## 🧭 Getting Started

To integrate these macros into your workflow:
1. Choose or customize a macro relevant to your current objective.
2. Use the `Summon_Card_Generator.md` if creating a new GPT instance.
3. Pair reflective tools (like `Claim_Distiller`, `Coherence_Scanner`) with mode selectors for deeper dialogue design.
4. Archive all turning points using `Checkpoint_Capturer.md` and `Fallout_Logger.md`.

## 🧬 Attribution

This toolkit was derived from the **Voice Framework** architecture, designed for recursive, co-reflective AI interaction.  
For system fidelity, retain logical scaffolding and modular conventions when adapting.
