# GPT Tools 🖠️

A curated collection of **GPT‑based modular tools and helper scripts**, designed to simplify a variety of tasks—from text processing and prompt engineering to data analysis and automation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository hosts several **standalone GPT-powered utilities** that can be used individually or combined into larger workflows. Each tool lives in its own folder and includes:

* A short description of its purpose
* Usage examples & requirements
* Input/Output behavior
* Installation steps & dependencies

## 📂 Project Structure

```
GPT_Tools/
├── tool1_featureA/
│   ├── README.md       # describes featureA
│   ├── scriptA.py      # example implementation
│   └── requirements.txt
├── tool2_featureB/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── main.js
└── LICENSE.md
```

* `tool1_featureA` – e.g., **Batch Prompt Generator**: builds prompt lists from CSV.
* `tool2_featureB` – e.g., **Chat Export Formatter**: processes and prettifies ChatGPT logs.
* Add new tools by creating a subfolder with its own `README.md`.

---

## 🧹 Embedded Tools

Each tool folder should include:

* **What it does** – concise description
* **Usage / Demo** – CLI or usage instructions
* **Dependencies** – language, libraries, runtime, models
* **Installation** – `pip install`, `npm install`, etc.
* **Examples** – sample input & expected output
