# GPT Tools 🧰🧠

A hybrid toolkit for advanced **prompt engineering**, **AI architecture design**, and **reflective interaction**.
This repository includes both executable tools and markdown-based logic macros compatible with systems like the **Voice Framework**.

---

## 🌟 Purpose

This repo exists to support two main use cases:

1. **Scripting + Automation Tools** – For developers who want to generate prompts, process AI outputs, or chain AI calls.
2. **Framework-Compatible Logic Modules** – For prompt engineers, researchers, or AI designers using tools like the *Voice Framework* to build reflective, recursive agents.

---

## 📦 Contents

### 🛠️ Executable Tools (`tool_<feature>/`)

* Python or JS scripts
* Installable via pip/npm
* Designed to automate or transform GPT workflows

### 🧩 Logic Macros (`AI_Macro_Toolkit_Starter/`)

* Markdown modules
* No code execution needed
* Used in system prompts, summon cards, memory scaffolds, and agent architecture

## 🔍 Example Tool Types

| Tool                            | Type   | Description                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Batch Prompt Generator`        | Script | Generates mass prompts from CSV                   |
| `Chat Export Formatter`         | Script | Cleans and prettifies `.json` chat exports        |
| `Claim Distiller`               | Macro  | Extracts logical claims from symbolic language    |
| `Structured Resistance Toolkit` | Macro  | Deploys tiered challenge modes (SR-Lite → SR-Max) |

## 🧠 Voice Framework Tools (Highlight)

Several modules here are built specifically for or inspired by the **Voice Framework**, a recursive co-reflective system for AI-human insight tracking.

Voice-compatible modules include:

* `Fallout_Logger.md`
* `Checkpoint_Capturer.md`
* `Trace_Macro.md`
* `Meta_Mode_Decision_Assistant.md`
* `Summon_Card_Generator.md`

These are **logic components**, not scripts—they shape how GPT behaves when used as a reflective partner or system engine.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mmcculley/GPT_Tools.git
   ```

2. **Run scripts** (if applicable)

   ```bash
   cd tool_<feature>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Use macros in your GPT workflows**

   * Copy any `.md` macro into your custom GPT system instructions
   * Use them to scaffold behavior, track insight, or shape interaction style

## 🦯 Roadmap

* [ ] Add a `/docs` folder with usage guides for non-coders
* [ ] Publish Voice Summon Card with modular references
* [ ] Create full CLI menu for launching tools
* [ ] Add example JSON→macro→summary flows

## 🧥 Contribute

PRs welcome! Add new tools in their own folder with:

* A `README.md` explaining intent and usage
* Scripts or markdown macros as appropriate
* Tests (if script-based)
